# Abstract
Joint modelling has been a useful strategy for incorporating latent associations between different
types of outcomes simultaneously, often focusing on a longitudinal outcome characterized by a
linear mixed effects (LME) submodel and a terminal event subject to a Cox proportional hazard
or parametric survival submodel. Applications to hierarchical longitudinal studies have been less
frequent, particularly with respect to a binary process, which is commonly specified by a generalized
linear mixed effects model (GLMM). Furthermore, many of the joint model developments have not
allowed for investigations of nested effects, such as those arising from multicenter studies. To fill this
gap, we propose a multilevel joint model that encompasses LME and GLMM submodels through a
Bayesian approach. Motivated by the need for timely detection of pulmonary exacerbations and
characterization of irregularly observed lung function measurements in people living with cystic
fibrosis (CF) receiving care across multiple centers, we apply the model to data arising from the
US CF Foundation Patient Registry. In parallel, we examine the extent of bias induced when ignoring
center effect in such settings. Our simulation study and application results show that incorporating
center effect along with individual stochastic variation over time within the LME submodel improves
model estimation and prediction. Given that the center effect is evident in lung function observed
on the CF population, accounting for center-index power parameters by incorporating the symmetric
power exponential power (spep) link function in the GLMM submodel can facilitate more accurate
conclusions in clinical studies.
